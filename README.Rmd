# WiNS Starting Kit <img src="imag/sticker.jpg" align="right" width="180px"/>

In this repository you will find useful resources for Women in Network Sciences (WiNS), as a Starting Kit with Networks.  

ðŸ–Š Author/Maintainer: **Repository maintain by Postgraduate Committe of WiNS council**. If you would like to add information, or suggest some changes, please contact Francisca Ortiz (Postgraduate rep) by email: **franortizruiz@gmail.com**. 

Another repository that may be interesting for you, it is the one created with information for [postgraduates Women in Network Science](https://github.com/FranciscaOrtizRuiz/wins_postgraduate)

## Books and places where to start learning about networks ðŸŒ»ðŸ“–

Next, you will find different types of resources that you could use to learn from the basics until the advances of Networks.
