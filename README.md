# WiNS Starting Kit

In this repository you will find useful resources for Women in Network
Sciences (WiNS), as a Starting Kit with Networks.

**Repository maintain by Postgraduate Committe of WiNS council**. If you
would like to add information, or suggest some changes, please contact
Francisca Ortiz (Postgraduate rep) by email:
**<franortizruiz@gmail.com>**.

Another repository that may be interesting for you, it is the one
created with information for [postgraduates Women in Network
Science](https://github.com/FranciscaOrtizRuiz/wins_postgraduate)

## Books and places where to start learning about networks 🌻📖

Next, you will find different types of resources that you could use to
learn from the basics until the advances of Networks.
